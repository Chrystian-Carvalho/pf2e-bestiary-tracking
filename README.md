A Foundry VTT module for the Pathfinder Second Edition (PF2E) system. It adds a bestiary where a GM can add creatures that the party have faced off against, heard off, or through some other means gained information about. Once added, the GM can choose which information about the monsters to reveal for players to be able to see within the bestiary.
# Module Settings
- The information revealed to players can be tailored to be 'vague', showing it generally as 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' or a likewise convention.
- Monsters added to a combat encounter can be automatically added to the Bestiary when the combat is started.
# Neat Things
- The front page of the Bestiary lists a simple one-line macro to immediately open the bestiary to the page of a targeted monster token.
