A Foundry VTT module for the Pathfinder Second Edition (PF2E) system. It adds a bestiary where a GM can add creatures, npcs and hazards that the party have faced off against, heard off, or through some other means gained information about. Once added, the GM can choose which information about the monsters to reveal for players to be able to see within the bestiary. Notes can be kept on the bestiary entities and other information can be kept track of.

Here the useage of the module aswell as its module settings are explained ðŸ¤–
A common point of confusion is [adding NPCs to the bestiary](https://github.com/WBHarry/pf2e-bestiary-tracking/wiki/Basics#regarding-npcs).

# For users updating from an old version
Unfortunately there was a point in development where a bad data issue happened. It effected some users that were trying out module at the time, and wasn't something I could reasonable fix in a migration.
If you're getting errors in this kind of situation, there is a `Bestiary Reset` macro included in the compendium section from this modue. It will remove any existing Bestiary data and update the data structure so everything will work well again.
