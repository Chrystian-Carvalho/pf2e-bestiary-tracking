A Foundry VTT module for the Pathfinder Second Edition (PF2E) system. It adds a bestiary where a GM can add creatures that the party have faced off against, heard off, or through some other means gained information about. Once added, the GM can choose which information about the monsters to reveal for players to be able to see within the bestiary.
